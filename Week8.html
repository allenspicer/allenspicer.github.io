<h1>
   Captain's Choice
</h1>
<p> This week I'm taking a app design from a student at the Austin, TX Iron Yard and bringing it to life!</p>
<p> The design I chose provides a team captain with a beautifully simple and powerful interface. The opening screen, displayed below, summarizes the most relevant information - the upcoming game - with simple buttons to explore additional details.</p>

<p>It's interesting to watch because the horse and jockey pairs don’t all run the same way. If they did only two things would really matter: a horse's speed and how quickly it gets out of the gate.</p>

<p>Anyone in the stands would tell you it’s not so simple. That’s why countless people show up to put their hard-earned money on the line. Jockeys work hard to get their timing just right. There's weather, there's timing and a million reasons that a jockey or horse will have a good day or bad. </p>

<p>Sitting in a room of people struggling forward with code, I can’t help but feel like I’m running out of the gate, trying to be sure to hit the ground as it goes by. We don't have much time here and you can always go faster - there is always more to learn. </p>

<p> I also have started to recognize - if not be comfortable with - the unsettling sensation that I don't know where I'm headed. </p>

 <p> Trying to create an app that takes users input and kicks out some useful information (whether it is prime, what it's prime factors are) I finally dissolved into a state of flow - trusting my destination to be there and simply problem solving to get there. Each step forward was a matter of procedure - dissecting errors and incompatibility instead of grazing through lines of jargon.</p>

<p>When I looked up I was somewhere I couldn't have seen from the start. And it felt incredible.</p>
