<h1>
   Captain's Choice
</h1>
<p> This week I'm taking a app design from a student at the Austin, TX Iron Yard and bringing it to life!</p>
<p> The design I chose, originally called TeamSkip, provides a team captain with a beautifully simple and powerful interface. The opening screen, displayed below, summarizes the most relevant information - the upcoming game - with simple buttons to explore additional details.</p>

<h2>
   Home Screen

<p> The primary challenge I encountered with this design was getting all the detail mocked-up and implemented in my very short timeframe. I selected a design Tuesday afternoon and completed the working app Friday morning - just about three days.
  I agressivly maintained a Trello board with "To Do", "In Progress", "Approved By Client" and "Done" columns and I found on Friday morning there were still many improvements I wanted to make.
  I'm planning to go back and continue to improve this project because at it's core I really do enjoy the design. </p>

<p> The landing screen displayed above allows the team captain to see the field and detail for today's game and quickly move to previous and future games. The team captain can text all team members as well.
This app is built around a tab view controller - allowing the user to quickly move to multiple other screens. I really apprecaite when apps use this because it allows multiple different contexts to exist simply, side-by-side.
Very successful apps like Spotify have gone back to using a tab view controller for this very reason.
</p>
<p>I struggled to find and match the tab buttons chosen by the designer. I wish they were more common, or files could have been included with the design. Although I custom built buttons I ultimately returned to Apple's standardized buttons because the one's I built did not integrate well.</p>

<h2>
   Player View
</h2>

<p>The 'Player view' is dispalyed under the second tab. The initial view for this tab is a table view displaying a profile picture, name and percentage of games attended.
Clicking on a player results in the detail screen, displayed above. </p>

<p>This tab allows the user to open an edit all information related to a player on their team.
  I prioritized funcionality over form, and allow the user to see and edit their statistics in one place.
  There are obvious differences from the design but I was glad to simply get the editing capability built and the autolayout done.
  This portion of the app could use more work but does work on iPads and iPhones alike and serves the core needs of the user.
  </p>

  <h2>
     League View
  </h2>

  <p>It is not obvious from the screenshots but managing the data for user was the largest coding challenge.
I spent an entire day simply setting up and and implementing Firebase, a Google-owned "Backend As A Service".
Firebase provides a free and very fast back-end for the application creating a very powerful app very quickly.
The team rank, team name, and team record displayed above can be quickly modified by a league administrator and will instantly update in the app as soon as an internet connection is available.
Nearly all the information displayed in the app is connected this way - so an administrator can provide quick notice of cancellations, update game details and create new teams quickly and easily.
I found Firebase lead to many logisitcal challenges that a differnt back end might not have created.
Simply storing the necessary data on the device with Core Data or using Defaults would look the same here but ultimately would mean an app with little usefulness.
  </p>

<p>I added some features not included in the design but removed some features as well.
There is an app icon, a landing page, a live database and the ability to text others by seamlessly integrating with Apple's Messages app.
I removed the forum feature the designer built because getting it done would have taken crucial time away from more fundamental parts of the app.
The text feature accomodates somewhat for the lack of a native forum feature, although it could be a nice item to add back in the future.
