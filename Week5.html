<h1>The Obstacle Is The Way</h1>
<br><br>
<p>
As iOS developers we live in the world of Objective-C and Swift, two languages competing for our attention. Objective-C came around in the 80's and was adopted by the Steve Jobs start-up NeXT then by Apple as well when the companies merged. 
<br><br>
Objective-C was not really purpose-built for it's implementation and arguably one of the more impressive things to come out of Apple under Tim Cook's tenure is a replacement (or update, depending on how you look at it).
<br><br>
Thirty years is a long time in the software development world and Apple is right to make the large investment they have in this behind-the-scenes project. With Swift, Apple intends to have safer, more readable programs and empower a larger audience of programmers as well.
<br><br>
I was really looking forward to moving on from Objective-C and into Swift, but slowly studying Objective-C has gone from frustrating to straight-forward. What felt archaic at first is now familiar.
<br><br>
Our pace is extreme though. With just 12 weeks to take in a huge skill-set we don't have time to rest on our laurels. This challenge of a new language, like the challenges before, is mostly only intimidating because it is unfamiliar. 
<br><br>
While it has proven a big challenge to think in one language and move to the other, it's also a consistent reminder of the time and effort I need to put in. For me, the goal of moving seamlessly through the workings of my favorite apps is constantly appealing. Building these things and figuring out how they work is fun! However I'm only going to get there with a healthy portion of grit.
<br><br>
When we come to an intimidating obstacle it should never be a moment of panic. Easier said than done, but it does help me to see in each frustration the opportunity for a lesson to be learned. For many of my frustrations lately the lesson is simple: there is more work to do.
